This project leverages TypeScript features to enhance code reliability and maintainability. Here are some key concepts you might encounter:

    Interfaces: Define the structure of objects, ensuring they have the required properties and types.
    Types: Annotations that specify the data type of variables, functions, and properties (e.g., string, number, boolean).
    Classes: Encapsulate data (properties) and behavior (methods) with type safety and access control (public, private, protected).
